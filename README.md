# zCalendar
 A simple event calendar that will help you manage your daily tasks.
 This app will store tasks in LocalStorage (for now), i will eventually integrate database as soon as possible. If you are a developer here then, the code is pretty messed up for this app. I will keep refactoring it and improving it. But, for now i will be keeping it as it is.
 You can visit live preview on top right of this webpage, a tutorial is included which will guide you how to use this app.
